Usage: $(basename $0) [PATH] [URL]

Sugar Network sneakernet synchronization utility.

Command arguments:
  PATH      if specified, utility will try to recursive search for
            synchronization packet files (files with ".packet" suffix);
            using wget or curl utility, each packet will be uploaded
            to the targeting Sugar Network server with downloading resulting
            packets; on success, uploaded packets will be removed and resulting
            packets will be placed to PATH instead
  URL       if specified, should be Sugar Network API url, e.g.,
            http://api-testing.network.sugarlabs.org; script will download
            full data dump from the server

Utility is intended to upload request packet files (generated by Sugar Network
node servers) to Sugar Network master server and download response packets
to deliver them back to nodes.

See http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Network for details.
