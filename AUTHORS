**Original idea**

This work was initially started as an international research initiative
in late 2011 within the `Sugar Labs Perú`_ in order to attend the needs
identified during field work on Perú from 2007 to date.

**SAT solver**

The SAT solver was inherited from the `Zero Install`_ project (until switching
its code base from Python) and adapted to Sugar Network needs. The original
code was licensed under the term of the :doc:`GPL-3.0 <COPYING>`.

**Artwork**
