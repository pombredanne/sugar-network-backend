How to contribute
=================

Useful notes how to contribute to the project.

**Before committing**

All source files need to be passed through `sugar-lint`_ command
(see the `"Lint files before committing"` section on sugar-lint home page),
or, call `pylint`_ and `pep8.py`_ utilities with the same `configuration`_
as sugar-lint uses.

**Send patches**

Create your patches using ``git format`` command and send them to all maintainers
from the :doc:`AUTHORS <AUTHORS>` file. The easiest way is just using ``git send-email`` command.

**Gitorious forks**

Another useful way to contribute, especially for big improvements, is creating
Gitorious forks and request them for merge to the trunk.
