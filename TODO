- nocache for diff()
- find only within `accept_range` ranges in DocumentClass.diff()
- if not completed populate (but commit happened) was aborted, the rest of populate will be skipped next populate
- do not sync objects that were created and deleted before syncing
- more relibale db update on schema changes
- implement authentication
- make `Directory.diff()` more precise for and avoid using `seqno..` searches if there are closed ranges

- query for all docs, return document name
- limit uploaded size, at least for blobs
- upload blobs by external url
- range generators for bool and dates
- (?) hide new docs in IndexProxy
- use read/write processes for master server
- IndexProxy should be smarter to take into account sorting of cached documents
- i18n for SN content
