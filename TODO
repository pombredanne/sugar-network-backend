- (!) Editors' workflows:
  - (?) log all (including editros) posters of particular document to minimize conflicts about why somthing was changed
    or better, detailed log for every editor's change
  - restrict sync content, especially for actiivity versions

- after reconnection to subscription (eg, when HTTP proxy closed the connection), recall cmd=stat
- GC implementations cache
- get all localized strings from activity.info while populating local contexts
- activities migth need MIME registering while checking-in
- changed pulls should take into account accept_length
- i18n activity.info's strings
- more consistent launch; right now
  - zerosugar/pipe.py uses several mountpoints
  - what mountpoints for deps
- handle DELETE while calculating per-object node stats
