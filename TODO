- delete outdated impls on PUTing new one

- (!) Editors' workflows:
  - (?) log all (including editros) posters of particular document to minimize conflicts about why somthing was changed
    or better, detailed log for every editor's change
  - restrict sync content, especially for actiivity versions

- after reconnection to subscription (eg, when HTTP proxy closed the connection), recall cmd=stat
- GC implementations cache
- get all localized strings from activity.info while populating local contexts
- activities migth need MIME registering while checking-in
- changed pulls should take into account accept_length
- i18n activity.info's strings
- more consistent launch; right now
  - zerosugar/pipe.py uses several mountpoints
  - what mountpoints for deps
- handle DELETE while calculating per-object node stats
- process depencies for non-/ mountpoint launches
- unstall activities on checking out and on initial syncing
- "Cannot find implementation for" error if there is no required sugar
  - trace says that current sugar version is (ok)
- increase granularity for sync.chunked_encode()
- slave._Pooler might leak events if pullers are not in time to call wait()
- revert per-document "downloads" property as "launches", a part of unpersonizalied user_stats
