- (!) Editors' workflows:
  - (?) log all (including editros) posters of particular document to minimize conflicts about why somthing was changed
    or better, detailed log for every editor's change
- Remove temporal security hole with speciying guid in POST,
  it was added as a fast hack to support offline creation (with later pushing to a node)
- changed pulls should take into account accept_length
- handle DELETE while calculating per-object node stats
- increase granularity for sync.chunked_encode()
- slave._Pooler might leak events if pullers are not in time to call wait()
- revert per-document "downloads" property as "launches", a part of unpersonizalied user_stats
- sync node->local db sync
- parse command while uploading impls; while parsing, take into accoun quotes
- secure node-to-node offline sync
