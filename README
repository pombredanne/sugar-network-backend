Sugar Network is a `Sugar Labs`_ project. It is a content sharing and
social activity system for `Sugar Learning Environment`_. The system
is intended to be a share point for various content (like Sugar applications,
content created by such applications, books and articles, etc.) created
and/or supported within the Sugar community. The Sugar Network is being
targeted not only to the Internet auditory but also to primary and secondary
educational institutions including ones that have lack of Internet connectivity
and/or skilled administrative personnel, e.g., rural schools.

See the `home page`_ for more details.
